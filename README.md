# Project Name: Innovative Enhancement in Online Delivery Service

## Overview
With the rising demand for efficient and reliable delivery services, our project aims to enhance the item delivery process in eCommerce through the integration of advanced technologies such as AI, Machine Learning, and automated systems. This project addresses challenges such as unreliable delivery updates, poor routing, and ineffective feedback mechanisms to improve customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.

## Research Problem
How can the integration of advanced technologies, such as AI, Machine Learning, and automated systems, enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the item delivery process in eCommerce?

## Objectives
### Main Objective
- To implement a system that increases the efficiency and effectiveness of the item delivery process.

### Sub-Objectives
1. Develop an automated voice activation system to enhance delivery time prediction.
2. Analyze employee behavior and identify improvements as a percentage.
3. Implement a fleet management system with delivery path optimization and weather prediction.
4. Analyze customer satisfaction (CSAT) regarding item delivery through voice-based feedback.
